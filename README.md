# Wordle-TUI
#### A Wordle game, built in the terminal!

## UNFINISHED
This currently just prints out an array of numbers, depending if the individual letters from your guess are correct. I will **eventually** add a full TUI, as I'm currently working on it.
#### Current To-Do List:
- [x] Add support for a local wordlist
- [ ] Use a TUI framework/library (in progress)
- [ ] Add varying lengths of words (instead of the usual 5)

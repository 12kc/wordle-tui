## UNFINISHED
This currently just prints out an array of numbers, depending if the individual letters from your guess are correct. I will **eventually** add tview support, as I'm currently working on it.
#### Current To-Do List:
- [x] Add support for a local wordlist
- [ ] Use [tview](https://github.com/rivo/tview/) as a TUI framework
- [ ] Add varying lengths of words (instead of the usual 5)
